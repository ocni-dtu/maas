"""Register models with Django.

We used to do this directly from `models/__init__.py`, as a side effect of
importing from that package, but it led to `AlreadyRegistered` errors when
running some tests in isolation (even when the import only happened once).

Django automatically discovers the `admin` module and ensures that models are
only registered once.
