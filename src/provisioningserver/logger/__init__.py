"""Logging in MAAS: region, rack, and at the command-line.

Logging is complex:

- The standard library has a `logging` module that needs to be configured. It
  can be complex and needs an significant time investment to fully understand.
  The `logging.basicConfig` helper can be used to get going, but third-party
  libraries often have very different ideas of what an informational message
  is (they often overestimate their own importance and emit as informational
  what someone else would at best consider a debug message) so levels must be
  adjusted; it's not enough to just `basicConfig()` and go.

- Twisted has a "legacy" logging system in `twisted.python.log`. This is still
  widely used in Twisted (16.0) and is the primary logging mechanism used by
  `twistd`. It has no concept of logging beyond "message" and "error".

- Twisted has a new logging system in `twisted.logger`. This is richer than
  the legacy logging system, less complex than `logging`, and emphasises that
  logs are not merely lines of text, but are structured events.

- Parts of the legacy Twisted logging system has been reimplemented to use the
  modern system. It works but the wiring can be confusing.

- The standard library has a `warnings` module. It invites users to replace
  its `showwarning` function in order to change where warnings are reported,
  and the standard library's `logging` module can be asked to do just that,
  something that Django does. But Twisted also replaces `showwarning` when
  logging is initialised. The winner is the one that goes last, meaning it's
  important to initialise parts of the application in a stable order.

- `warnings` tests each warning against a list of filters. This is populated
  by two functions — `filterwarnings` and `simplefilter` — as well as by `-W`
  options given at the command-line. The winner is the last to add a filter,
  so the order of initialisation of the application is again a concern.

- Django configures both `logging` and `warnings` during initialisation. In
  MAAS, Django often gets initialised late in the start-up process. It can end
  up winning the configuration race — by coming last — unless steps are taken
  to prevent it.

- Log levels and log level names between Twisted and `logging` are not
  consistent, and need normalising in order to produce a consistent log when
  both systems are in use.

This module attempts to address *all* of these issues!
