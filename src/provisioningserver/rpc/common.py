      `message`. This message must be unique to avoid replay attacks.

    - The remote side adds some salt to the message, and calculates an HMAC
      digest, keyed with the shared secret.

      The salt is intended to prevent replay attacks: it prevents an intruder
      from authenticating itself by calling `Authenticate` on the caller (or
      another endpoint in the same MAAS installation) and sending the same
      message, receiving the digest and passing it back to the caller.

    - The remote side returns this digest and the salt. The caller performs
      the same calculation, and compares the digests.

    - If the digests match, the connection is put into rotation.

    - If the digests do not match, the connection is closed immediately, and
      an error is logged.
