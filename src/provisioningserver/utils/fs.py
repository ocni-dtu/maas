    This behaviour comes about by:

    * Taking a process-global lock before performing any file-system

    * Using :class:`twisted.python.lockfile.FilesystemLock` under the hood.
      This does not permit double-locking of a file by the name process (or by
      any other process, naturally).

    There are options too:

    * `SystemLock` uses the given path as its lock file. This is the most
      general lock.

    * `FileLock` adds a suffix of ".lock" to the given path and uses that as
      its lock file. Use this when updating a file in a writable directory,
      for example.

    * `RunLock` puts its lock file in ``/run/lock`` with a distinctive name
      based on the given path. Use this when updating a file in a non-writable
      directory, for example.

    * `NamedLock` also puts its lock file in ``/run/lock`` but with a name
      based on the given _name_. `NamedLock`'s lock file are named in such a
      way that they will never conflict with a `RunLock`'s. Use this to
      synchronise between processes on a single host, for example, where
