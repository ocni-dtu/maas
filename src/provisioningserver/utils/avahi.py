"""Utilities for working with avahi.

Requires the `avahi-utils` package.

Note that `avahi-browse` does not seem to return data with consistent address
families. In order to gather complete information, one could use the data from
`avahi-browse` in conjunction with `avahi-resolve`. For example, if a hostname
of `foo.local` is discovered with `avahi-browse`, the following commands could
be used to resolve it:

$ avahi-resolve -6 -n foo.local
foo.local fe80::95de:80ff:fe6a:cb54

$ avahi-resolve -4 -n foo.local
foo.local 192.168.0.155

However, `avahi-resolve` does not allow interface selection, so it is still
possible that the result could be incorrect.

The mDNS RFC (RFC 6762) provides a clue about why this might be in its "IPv6
Considerations" section[1]. mDNS has the concept of "two separate .local
domains", one of which can be seen by IPv4-only hosts, the other which can
be seen by IPv6-only hosts. Dual-stack hosts can see both. When a dual stack
host resolves a service using mDNS, it may prefer one address family over
another.
