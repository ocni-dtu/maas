"""Management command: upgrade the cluster.

This module implements the `ActionScript` interface for rackd commands.

Use the upgrade-cluster command when the MAAS code has been updated (e.g. while
installing a package ugprade, from the packaging) to perform any data
migrations that the new version may require.

This maintains a list of upgrade hooks, each representing a data migration
that was needed at some point in development of the MAAS cluster codebase.
All these hooks get run, in chronological order.  There is no record of
updates that have already been performed; each hook figures out for itself
whether its migration is needed.

Backwards migrations are not supported.
