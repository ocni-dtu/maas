"""Support for managing nodes via Cisco UCS Manager's HTTP-XML API.

It's useful to have a cursory understanding of how UCS Manager XML API
works. Cisco has a proprietary document that describes all of this in
more detail, and I would suggest you get a copy of that if you want more
information than is provided here.

The Cisco DevNet website for UCS Manager has a link to the document,
which is behind a login wall, and links to example UCS queries:

https://developer.cisco.com/web/unifiedcomputing/home

UCS Manager is a tool for managing servers. It provides an XML API for
external applications to use to interact with UCS Manager to manage
servers. The API is available via HTTP, and requests and responses are
made of XML strings. MAAS's code for interacting with a UCS Manager is
concerned with building these requests, sending them to UCS Manager, and
processing the responses.

UCS Manager stores information in a hierarchical structure known as the
management information tree. This structure is exposed via the XML API,
where we can manipulate objects in the tree by finding them, reading
them, and writing them.

Some definitions for terms that are used in this code:

Boot Policy - Controls the boot order for a server. Each service profile
is associated with a boot policy.

Distinguished Name (DN) - Each object in UCS has a unique DN, which
describes its position in the tree. This is like a fully qualified path,
and provides a way for objects to reference other objects at other
places in the tree, or for API users to look up specific objects in the
tree.

Class - Classes define the properties and states of objects. An object's
class is given in its tag name.

Managed Object (MO) - An object in the management information tree.
Objects are recursive, and may have children of multiple types. With the
exception of the root object, all objects have parents. In the XML API,
objects are represented as XML elements.

Method - Actions performed by the API on managed objects. These can
change state, or read the current state, or both.

Server - A physical server managed by UCS Manager. Servers must be
associated with service profiles in order to be used.

Service Profile - A set of configuration options for a server. Service
profiles define the server's personality, and can be migrated from
server to server. Service profiles describe boot policy, MAC addresses,
network connectivity, IPMI configuration, and more. MAAS requires
servers to be associated with service profiles.

UUID - The UUID for a server. MAAS persists the UUID of each UCS managed
server it enlists, and uses it as a key for looking the server up later.
