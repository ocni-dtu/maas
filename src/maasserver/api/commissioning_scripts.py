        """Create a new commissioning script.

        Each commissioning script is identified by a unique name.

        By convention the name should consist of a two-digit number, a dash,
        and a brief descriptive identifier consisting only of ASCII
        characters.  You don't need to follow this convention, but not doing
        so opens you up to risks w.r.t. encoding and ordering.  The name must
        not contain any whitespace, quotes, or apostrophes.

        A commissioning machine will run each of the scripts in lexicographical
        order.  There are no promises about how non-ASCII characters are
        sorted, or even how upper-case letters are sorted relative to
        lower-case letters.  So where ordering matters, use unique numbers.

        Scripts built into MAAS will have names starting with "00-maas" or
        "99-maas" to ensure that they run first or last, respectively.

        Usually a commissioning script will be just that, a script.  Ideally a
        script should be ASCII text to avoid any confusion over encoding.  But
        in some cases a commissioning script might consist of a binary tool
        provided by a hardware vendor.  Either way, the script gets passed to
        the commissioning machine in the exact form in which it was uploaded.

        :param name: Unique identifying name for the script.  Names should
            follow the pattern of "25-burn-in-hard-disk" (all ASCII, and with
            numbers greater than zero, and generally no "weird" characters).
        :param content: A script file, to be uploaded in binary form.  Note:
            this is not a normal parameter, but a file upload.  Its filename
            is ignored; MAAS will know it by the name you pass to the request.
