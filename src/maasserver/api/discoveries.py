        on the rack controller using 'nmap' (if it is installed) or 'ping'.

        Network discovery must not be set to 'disabled' for this command to be

        Scanning will be started in the background, and could take a long time
        on rack controllers that do not have 'nmap' installed and are connected
        to large networks.

        results with the following keys:

        ``result``: A human-readable string summarizing the results.

        ``scan_attempted_on``: A list of rack system_id values where a scan
        was attempted. (That is, an RPC connection was successful and a
        subsequent call was intended.)

        ``failed_to_connect_to``: A list of rack system_id values where the
        RPC connection failed.

        ``scan_started_on``: A list of rack system_id values where a scan was
        successfully started.

        ``scan_failed_on``: A list of rack system_id values where a scan was
        attempted, but failed because a scan was already in progress.

        ``rpc_call_timed_out_on``: A list of rack system_id values where the
        RPC connection was made, but the call timed out before a ten second
        timeout elapsed.

        @param (string) "cidr" [required=false] The subnet CIDR(s) to scan (can
        be specified multiple times). If not specified, defaults to all
        networks.

        @param (boolean) "force" [required=false] If True, will force the scan,
        even if all networks are specified. (This may not be the best idea,
        depending on acceptable use agreements, and the politics of the
        organization that owns the network.) Note that this parameter is
        required if all networks are specified. Default: False.

        @param (string) "always_use_ping" [required=false] If True, will force
        the scan to use 'ping' even if 'nmap' is installed. Default: False.

        @param (string) "slow" [required=false] If True, and 'nmap' is being
        used, will limit the scan to nine packets per second. If the scanner is
        'ping', this option has no effect. Default: False.

        @param (string) "threads" [required=false] The number of threads to use
        during scanning. If 'nmap' is the scanner, the default is one thread
