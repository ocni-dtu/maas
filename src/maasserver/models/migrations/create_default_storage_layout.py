"""Migration to create the default storage layout on the boot disk.

WARNING: Although these methods will become obsolete very quickly, they
cannot be removed, since they are used by the
0181_initial_storage_layouts DataMigration. (changing them might also
be futile unless a customer restores from a backup, since any bugs that occur
will have already occurred, and this code will not be executed again.)

Note: Each helper must have its dependencies on any model classes injected,
since the migration environment is a skeletal replication of the 'real'
database model. So each function takes as parameters the model classes it
requires. Importing from the model is not allowed here. (but the unit tests
do it, to ensure that the migrations meet validation requirements.)
