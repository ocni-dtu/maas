    Implemented using PostgreSQL's advisory locking functions.

    PostgreSQL's advisory lock functions are all available with a choice
    of two call signatures: (64-bit integer) or (32-bit integer, 32-bit
    integer). Here we use the two-argument form.

    The first argument is fixed at 20120116. This makes it easy to
    identify locks belonging to the MAAS application in PostgreSQL's
    ``pg_locks`` table. For example::

      SELECT objid FROM pg_locks WHERE classid = 20120116;

    returns the second part of the lock key for all locks associated
    with the MAAS application.

    Fwiw, 20120116 is the date on which source history for MAAS began.
    It has no special significance to PostgreSQL, as far as I am aware.
