This is a place where all the Python libraries can be put, that need to
come from PyPI, rather than from a deb package.

The package and the required version should be put in requirements.txt,
which the snapcraft.yaml file references.

Our preference is to pull dependencies from the Ubuntu archive.
Dependencies should only be added to requirements.txt as a stop-gap
while waiting for the dependency to reach the Ubuntu archive.
